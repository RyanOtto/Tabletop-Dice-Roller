# Tabletop-Dice-Roller
A dice roller created with tabletop gaming in mind, which allows the user to choose dice number/side combinations and set rules for what numbers are successes/failures as per standard tabletop rules.
# How to run it
1. Download the runnable JAR file <a href="https://github.com/RyanOtto/Tabletop-Dice-Roller/blob/master/Dice%20Roller.jar">here</a>.
2. Click "rules" to set what counts as a success, failure, and critical success/failure (fields may be left blank if your ruleset doesn't account for them).
3. Click "choose dice" to set your dice combinations to roll, which should be in the format of number of dice to roll, the letter 'd', and the number of sides to each die (I.E. 5d20 for five twenty-sided dice).  Additional combos should be space-separated (I.E. 5d20 2d10 for five twenty-sided dice and two ten-sided dice).
4. Click "roll dice" to get your results.
